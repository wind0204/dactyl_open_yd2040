# Dactyl Open - YD2040
I've built a Dactyl Pivot - Open with bigger build, movable thumb pads, and tenting feature
and thought I might as well share some of the details on the internet.

The MCUs I used was good value, I guess. I don't have electronic knowledge to really evaluate it well. its name was YD-2040 V1.1;
And the firmware I used was [qmk](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware)
