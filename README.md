# dactyl_open_yd2040
I've built a dactyl pivot - open keyboard with bigger build, movable thumb pads, and tenting feature
and thought I might as well share some of the details.

The MCUs I used had good value, I guess. I don't have electronic knowledge to really evaluate it well. its name was YD-2040 V1.1;
And the firmware I used was [qmk](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware)
